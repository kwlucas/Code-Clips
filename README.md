<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Demo Image](./public/images/CodeClips-Image.PNG)

Managing the tabs upon tabs of documentation and references we use while coding was too much of a hassle. We wanted to create a tool for developers to be able to store bits of code, documentation, and references for future use.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Development

We began development by putting together a plan focused on a database schema. Once it was decided what the functionality of the application would look like we began to modularly build the application, each team member focusing on a specific aspect which would come together to produce a working final product. The primary challenge faced during this period were lapses in communication and the absence of a single shared vision. While the functionality needed from the application was made clear, the concept for the design and user interface was not as clearly communicated which hampered development, especially in the front-end.
The amount of progress lost to this "little" disconnect was a clear demonstration of just how important planning and communication is for a project and was a key takeaway for the group.
